Penn State (who ran the most plays in 2023) are clearly trying to chase their rival up north and has moved down to the middle of the pack. It has certainly worked for them through the first half of the season. This can also be a product of great offense - the more you score, the less plays you run.\nIn terms of the rule change affecting this year’s style of play, the majority of the teams (excluding Purdue) generally held pretty consistent in terms of how many plays they have run year-over-year. When it comes to overall success, the new rule doesn’t have much effect either because we see that great teams can run many plays or few plays and still be successful (again, Michigan at the bottom, OSU/PSU in the middle, and now Oregon at the top). The NCAA can try to change the rules, but they can’t seem to change how its teams play."
